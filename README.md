Feaverâ€™s goal of $10,000 - $12,000 can lower the chances of success. Most of the successful play campaigns were for amounts closer to $5000. A Goal of $10,000 may be tough, but is not unobtainable. 

Many of the failed campaigns have a lower median pledge amount. In order to maximize success, Feaver will need to appeal to individuals who are willing to contribute higher amounts.
